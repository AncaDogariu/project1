Project1-Design Patterns

The first pattern implemented is Adapter Pattern, which is a structural design pattern, which allows incompatible objects to collaborate. 
The code is associated with a real file example as following : we have to fit some square shaped objects into round holes, showing how this pattern 
make incompatible objects work together. Details regarding how the adapter class helps us are written as comments in the files of the project.

The second pattern is the Observer Pattern, which define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state,
all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically.
The real life example on which the code is based is this: we have an online shop and every time there are some sales the customers are notified. 
In our pattern we identify the subject (the online shop) and the observers(the customers who were subscribing the online shop newsletter and will receive
the updates from the subject).
